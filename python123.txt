		Up above the world so high,   		
		Like a diamond in the sky. 
Twinkle, twinkle, little star, 
	How I wonder what you are
A)a=("Twinkle, twinkle, little star,\n\t How I wonder what you are!\n\t Up above the world so high,\n\t Like a diamond in the sky")
print(a)
4. Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area?
Sample Output :
r = 1.1
Area = 3.8013271108436504

from math import pi
x=float(input("Enter your radius:"))
print("The area of circle:"+str(pi*x**2))
6. Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from user and generate a list and a tuple with those numbers?
Sample data : 3, 5, 7, 23
Output :
List : ['3', ' 5', ' 7', ' 23']
Tuple : ('3', ' 5', ' 7', ' 23')
A)list=input("enter your number:")
values=list.split(",")
tuple=tuple(values)
print('list:',list)
print('tuple:',tuple)
14. Write a Python program to calculate number of days between two dates.
Sample dates : (2014, 7, 2), (2014, 7, 11)
Expected output : 9 days
A)from datetime import date
a=date(2014, 7, 2)
b=date(2014,7,11)
c=(b-a)
print(c)
22. Write a Python program to count the number 4 in a given list?
A)for example:
a=[1,2,3,3,4,2,1]
a.count(4)
print(a.count(4))
